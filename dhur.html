        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Alok Barman a 23 years of old man form the Great country INDIA. My hometown is Malda it's situated in Westbengal state, is a lovely town among the towns of India. I'm a graduated in English literature as welll as a free learner and that is the great result of achieving precious lessons and experiences.

I'm pessimistic in personally but I'm very optimistic when I take any responsibility. At the time when I become pessimistic in personal dealings then I try not to be sad rather I do what i like most and that are learning some great things. And when there is nothing to do I just come and sit before my machine and do coding and learn the another branches. In my view, learning practically is the best power in life.

I speak Bengali, English, Hindi and I'm learning some other languages, when I'll feel comfortable in them I'll add them here.
