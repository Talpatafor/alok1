<h3 style="text-align: center" >Descriptive type question and answer
 </h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center">“Macbeth”  by William Shakespeare </h4>
<p>
<span style="background-color: yellow">1/  Bring out the significance of the opening scene of “Macbeth”.</span><br><br>
            The opening scene of a play, plays a vital role. The play “Macbeth” opens with the return of the two Scottish Generals Macbeth and Banquo with victory from a great battle. Then they face the three witches in a atmosphere of thunder and lightning. The appearance of the weird sisters is very strange. Their riddle “Fair is foul, and foul is fair” hints at their evil intentions. They predict Macbeth and Banquo’s future. It arouses temptation in Macbeth. But Banquo pays no heed to their prophecies as he considers them to be the ‘ministers of darkness who often betrays humans.’ Therefore, the opening scene highlights the main theme of the play.<br><br>
<span style="background-color: yellow">  2/  What did each of the three witches predict to Macbeth when he first met them? What did they tell Banquo?</span><br><br>
          When Macbeth and Banquo were returning from the battlefield with great victory, they were stopped by the strange appearance of three figures. They made some predictions about both of them. The first witch referred Macbeth as the ‘thane of Glamis’. The second witch addressed him as the ‘thane of Cawdor’ which he was not. Finally, the third witch prophesied that Macbeth would become the ‘king of Scotland’. He was so surprised. But the predictions aroused hope in the heart of ambitious Macbeth.<br><br>
        Banquo was curious to know if the witches had anything to say about him. So, they turned towards him and declared in riddling terms, “To be lesser than Macbeth and greater, not so happy but much happier.” Before vanishing into the thin air, they prophesied that Banquo would never reign as the king of Scotland but his descendants would be the kings.<br><br>
<span style="background-color: yellow"> 3/  Sketch the character of Lady Macbeth. (or) Discuss Lady Macbeth as a fourth witch.</span><br><br>
         Lady Macbeth is the wife of Macbeth. She is considered as the fourth witch of the play because she is the friend in Macbeth’s cruel acts. She is equally responsible for both of her and Macbeth’s downfall. Hearing the prophecies of the three witches, the merciless, dominant and overly ambitious Lady Macbeth persuades Macbeth to murder Duncan. She knows that he is a kind hearted man but ambitious too so, like a cleaver politician she tempted him. She knows the art to be a perfect hostess to a guest like Duncan. She is crafty too, when we see her in the banquet scene. But her inability to kill Duncan by herself proves that she has womanly tenderness. Finally, being unable to bear guilt of her cruel deeds and the suffering of somnambulism she commits suicide.<br><br>
